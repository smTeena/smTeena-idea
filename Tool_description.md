# Tool Description file
The text analysis tool i found on github is a project created using Python programming language, to explore and analyse text without coding. It can summarize text and detect spam. Good for begginers and students analysing languages and texts.

However, on the repository i could not find which languages are recognised. So my suggestion would be to include that.

In addition in the repository i found:
- README.md file that explained this tool
- Files used to create it
- That 2 people helped create it
- What the main programming languages were used
